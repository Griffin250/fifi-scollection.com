<div id="qn-2">
    <h2>2. Who can order item(s) via the website?</h2>
    <p>You may order our item(s) if you have reached the legal age under the laws applicable to you and are legally capable to do so.</p>
    <P> We only sell our item(s) to end users and/or consumers who:</P>
    <ul>
        <li> Have a valid address in a region in which we deliver our item(s);</li>
        <li>Order the item(s) for their own personal use; and</li>

    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to refuse the sale of our item(s) to resellers, retailers, or bulk buyers.</p>
</div>
<div id="qn-3">
    <h2>3. When can you order item(s) via the website?</h2>
    <p>Although we do our best to enable you to purchase our item(s), it may be possible that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>   An item shown on our website is no longer available (which could be contrary to the availability status);</li>
        <li>  Additional restrictions may apply to item(s) of a “limited edition” or “limited production”, 
            for example restrictions on the number of item(s) you may purchase; or</li>
        <li>  It is not yet possible to ship our online item(s) to every country or region. 
            Please check our website for the countries and regions where we do ship our item(s) to.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div id="qn-4">
    <h2>4. How does the order procedure work?</h2>
    <p> 
        Of course, we are very pleased that you decided to order our item(s).
         Placing an order via our website is easy and consists of the following steps:</p>
         <p>1. Add the item(s) you like to order to your shopping cart;</p>
         <p>2. Proceed to “Order”;</p>
         <p>(i)    If you already have a Foot Locker account, please login. 
            If not, you can create your own account by registering on our website; or</p>
        <p>(ii)   If you order as a guest without creating an account, 
            please fill in all necessary information (such as your name, address, email address and telephone number);</p>
        <p>3. Check your information and your order before confirming;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the preferred shipping method;</li>
            <li>Choose one of the available payment methods;</li>
            <li>Before placing an order, you will need to agree to these Rules of the Game;</li>
            <li>Proceed to place the order and pay for the item(s) (you have now entered into a binding obligation). 
                You must complete the payment in the manner of payment chosen by you.
                 As long as you have not completed the payment, the item(s) will not be reserved but as soon as we have received the payment confirmation, the order will be executed. 
                This means that if you wait too long in making the payment, the risk increases that the item(s) will no longer be available;</li>
            <li>You will receive an email with all the details of your purchase. 
                At this point a binding contract (the “Purchase Agreement”), containing these Rules of the Game, comes into existence; and</li>
            <li>As soon as we have shipped your item(s), you will receive a shipping confirmation by email.</li>
        </ul>
</div>

<div id="qn-5">
    <h2>5. When may we cancel your order?</h2>
    <p>We are entitled to refuse or cancel your order before the shipment of the item(s).
     However, we must have a justified reason for doing so.
     Examples of situations in which we can refuse or cancel an order include, but are not limited to:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>An obvious error or other incorrectness with regard to (an) item(s) offered by us;</li>
        <li> The item(s) is/are not available or in stock; 
        if this is so, we will inform you as soon as possible and will not process the order;</li>
        <li> Your invoice information is not correct or is impossible to verify;</li>
        <li>We have reason to believe that your order or payment is fraudulent;</li>
        <li>There is suspicion of credit card or debit card fraud;</li>
        <li>We cannot deliver to the address stated by you;</li>
        <li>We have reason to believe that you are not an end user and/or consumer;</li>
        <li> You are under the legal age following from the laws applicable; or</li>
        <li> Payment for the purchase is not reserved or made in full.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>In the above cases, we are not liable for damages or costs as a result of the refusal or cancellation of your order.</p>
</div>
